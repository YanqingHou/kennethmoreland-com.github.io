  <p>&quot;<span class="pubTitle">The FFT on a GPU</span>.&quot; Kenneth Moreland and Edward Angel. In <em>SIGGRAPH/Eurographics Workshop on Graphics Hardware 2003 Proceedings</em>, July 2003, pp. 112&ndash;119.</p>
  <h3>Abstract</h3>
  <p>The Fourier transform is a well known and widely used tool in  many scientific and engineering fields. The Fourier transform is essential  for many image processing techniques, including filtering, manipulation,  correction, and compression. As such, the computer graphics community  could benefit greatly from such a tool if it were part of the graphics  pipeline. As of late, computer graphics hardware has become amazingly  cheap, powerful, and flexible. This paper describes how to utilize the  current generation of cards to perform the fast Fourier transform (FFT)  directly on the cards. We demonstrate a system that can synthesize an  image by conventional means, perform the FFT, filter the image, and  finally apply the inverse FFT in well under 1 second for a 512 by 512  image. This work paves the way for performing complicated, real-time  image processing as part of the rendering pipeline. </p>
  <h3>Publication</h3>
  <p><a href="fftgpu.pdf">Get the paper</a> by clicking this link. Note that in the original publication in the  workshop proceedings has an error in Equation 6. The electronic form  distributed here has a correction.  </p>
  <h3>Code</h3>
  <p>At the time of publication I archived the software I was using to test the system and generate images.</p>
  <ul>
    <li> <a href="FFTFilters_src.zip">Source code</a> providing a demo (also used to generate the images in the paper).<br />
    </li>
    <li> <a href="FFTFilters_bin.zip">Windows binaries</a> of said demo. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>I have not touched this code much since publishing the paper, so  it is probably out of date. So far no one has reported catastrophic  problems that have not been fixed, although I have heard of problems  with rendering artifacts.<sup><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup></p>
  <h3>Supplemental Code</h3>
  <p>For those of you who are really adventurous, I have also archived  the rest of the source code I generated during my Ph.D. program. The  code is contained in a makeshift library called On-Card Algorithms  (OCA). It's basically a bunch of boilerplate encapsulated in C++ objects  to run Cg algorithms that do not fit will within the classical graphics  pipeline. You may or may not find that useful although now there are  more complete solutions such as <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_home.html">CUDA</a>, <a href="http://www.khronos.org/opencl/">OpenCL</a>, and many others<sup><a href="#footnote2">2</a></sup> now available.</p>
  <p>In this archive is also the collection of algorithms I happened to be working on at the time, such as in my <a href="../dissertation/">Dissertation</a>. You may enjoy looking through them although many will probably be a bit worthless and other may not even work.</p>

  <p>You will need <a href="http://www.cmake.org">CMake</a> in order to compile this code.</p>
  <h2>Other Implementations</h2>
  <p>This was the first paper to propose performing an FFT on a GPU.  However, since this publication, several other researchers have proposed  and implemented algorithms that are either easier to implement or more  efficient (or perhaps both). Before spending too much time understanding  all the details in this paper, consider looking at other  implementations. <a href="http://www.gpgpu.org">http://www.gpgpu.org</a> has links to several recent implementations.</p>

    <li><a name="footnote1" id="footnote1"></a>There is also a known  issue of a seg fault when you close the window. It's an issue with a bad  object deletion order. It does not occur when you stop the application  by hitting the 'q' key, and I have no interest in fixing it.<br />
    </li>
    <li><a name="footnote2" id="footnote2"></a>By the time you read  this, the list of GPGPU programming systems will probably have changed. See <a href="http://www.gpgpu.org">http://www.gpgpu.org</a> for the latest announcements and information.</li>
